## File comparison

[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/nodejs-java) is a library that helps you identify differences between two files, whether they are at the paragraph, word, or character level. It can even detect changes in styling and formatting, such as bold, italic, underlines, strike-throughs, and font types. 

## Apply/Reject changes between documents

Each difference identified between the compared documents can be either accepted or rejected, and subsequently, the results can be exported to the output document.

## Document information extraction

GroupDocs.ComparisonÂ allows obtaining basic information about the source files, such as file type, size, and page count, which can be used for generating previews of the compared documents.

## Comparison summary report

Once the comparison process is complete, you can save a summary report that lists all the differences between the compared documents.
