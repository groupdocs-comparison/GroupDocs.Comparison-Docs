[GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net) lets you query the list of detected changes after a comparison.

## Get list of changes from local disk

Run a comparison and iterate over the resulting `ChangeInfo` objects.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")
    comparer.compare()
    changes = comparer.get_changes()
    for change in changes:
        print(f"Type: {change.type}, Page: {change.page_info.page_number}, Id: {change.id}, Text: {change.text}")
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Build a custom report UI that lists all differences with pagination info.

## Get list of changes from stream

Compare from streams and retrieve the changes programmatically.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with open("source.docx", "rb") as src, open("target.docx", "rb") as tgt:
    with gc.Comparer(src) as comparer:
        comparer.add(tgt)
        comparer.compare()
        changes = comparer.get_changes()
        for change in changes:
            print(f"Type: {change.type}, Page: {change.page_info.page_number}, Id: {change.id}, Text: {change.text}")
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Integrate diff extraction into services that operate on file streams.
