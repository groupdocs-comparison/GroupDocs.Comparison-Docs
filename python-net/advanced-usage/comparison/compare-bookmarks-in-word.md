[GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net) supports bookmark comparison in Word documents.

## Enable bookmark comparison

Turn on bookmark comparison to detect differences in bookmarked ranges.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")
    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.compare_bookmarks = True
    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Validate that critical bookmarked sections (e.g., clauses) remain unchanged.

The result is as follows:
