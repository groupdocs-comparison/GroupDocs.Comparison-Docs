By default, GroupDocs.Comparison can include or ignore Word Track Changes (revisions) during comparison. Use `CompareOptions` to control this behavior.

## Example: Include Word revisions during comparison

Enable the comparison engine to detect and include tracked revisions (changes, comments, insertions, deletions) from Word documents when generating the comparison result. This ensures that any previously tracked changes are not lost during the comparison process.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source-with-revisions.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")

    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.word_track_changes = True  # include tracked revisions

    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

## Example: Ignore Word revisions during comparison

Compare only the final text and ignore previously tracked revisions so historical edits do not affect the diff.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source-with-revisions.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")

    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.word_track_changes = False  # ignore tracked revisions

    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Produce a clean diff focused on current content for executive review.

Note: Availability of particular options may depend on the document format and library version.

The result is as follows:

|                     WordTrackChanges true                      |

|                     WordTrackChanges false                      |
