Note: This feature applies to Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft PowerPoint, and OpenDocument presentations.

## Compare multiple documents (disk)

Add several targets and set styling for inserted items.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target1.docx")
    comparer.add("target2.docx")
    comparer.add("target3.docx")
    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.inserted_item_style = gc.StyleSettings(font_color=gc.Color.from_name("yellow"))
    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Aggregate changes across multiple proposal iterations into a single consolidated diff.

## Compare multiple documents (streams)

Perform the same operation using streams.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with open("source.docx", "rb") as src,
     open("target1.docx", "rb") as t1,
     open("target2.docx", "rb") as t2,
     open("target3.docx", "rb") as t3:
    with gc.Comparer(src) as comparer:
        comparer.add(t1)
        comparer.add(t2)
        comparer.add(t3)
        options = gc.CompareOptions()
        options.inserted_item_style = gc.StyleSettings(font_color=gc.Color.from_name("yellow"))
        with open("result.docx", "wb") as out_stream:
            comparer.compare(out_stream, options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Compare multiple contributions uploaded via API without persisting intermediate files.
