[GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net) supports sensitivity levels from 0 (fastest, least detailed) to 100 (slowest, most detailed).

[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net) allows you toÂ adjust comparison sensitivity toÂ achieveÂ the necessary balance betweenÂ the comparison speed and accuracy.Â Possible comparison sensitivity values range is fromÂ **0**Â toÂ **100**.

- **Minimal value**Â (**0**) sets sensitivity to a minimal value provides the fastest comparison speed, but it may produceÂ worst comparisonÂ quality.Â If there is at least one common letter in two compared words then these words are not treated as fully inserted and deleted
- **Value by default**Â means **75**. Comparison occurs when the percentage of deleted or inserted elements in relation to all elements does not exceed 75%
- **Maximum value**Â (**100**) provides the best quality, but slowestÂ comparison speed. Comparison occurs at any length of a common sub-sequence of two compared objects

For better understanding about how comparison algorithms workÂ let's suppose we have two strings:

| Strings                          |
| -------------------------------- |
| ` 1``. It is our equity poetry ` |
| ` 2``. Jack is a glad calf `     |

So, these strings have two common sub-sequences: "**is**" word and 4 space symbols.Â   
CommonÂ sub-sequence is -Â "Â **is** " and itsÂ length is 4 symbols (there areÂ 2 space symbols in it).  
Length of inserted sub-sequence is 13Â symbols -Â **Jackagladcalf**  
Removed sub-sequence length is 17Â symbols -Â **Itourequitypoetry\*_  
Lets calculate percent of removed and inserted symbols:Â (17 + 13) / (17 + 13 + 4) * 100 = 88%

*Case 1.*Â IfÂ **SensitivityOfComparison = 80%** comparison of these two strings producesÂ the next result:  
**Jack is a glad calfIt is our equity poetry**

Because calculatedÂ percent of removed and inserted symbols equalsÂ **88%**Â and it is bigger than value ofÂ **SensitivityOfComparison**Â equals **80%** then this common sub-sequence will be not taken into account.  
The first string considered completely removed and the second string considered completely inserted. The same results are produced for anyÂ calculated percent less thanÂ **83%**.

_Case 2._ If **SensitivityOfComparison = 89%**,Â comparison of these two strings producesÂ the next result:  
**JackItÂ isÂ aourÂ gladequityÂ calfpoetry**

Common sub-sequence was found, becauseÂ **89% > 88%**.Â The same results are produced for anyÂ calculated percentÂ bigger thanÂ **88%**.

## Adjust overall sensitivity

Increase sensitivity to detect smaller changes or reduce it for faster processing.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")
    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.sensitivity_of_comparison = 100
    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Maximize accuracy for legal or scientific documents where subtle edits matter.

## Adjust sensitivity for tables

Use a separate sensitivity value for tabular content.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")
    options = gc.CompareOptions()
    options.sensitivity_of_comparison = 100
    options.sensitivity_of_comparison_for_tables = 75
    comparer.compare("result.docx", options)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Tune detection granularity in tables while keeping overall sensitivity high.
