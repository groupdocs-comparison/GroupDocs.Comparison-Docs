# Compare PDF documents in Python

[GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net) makes it simple to **compare PDF documents** and identify changes in text, formatting, annotations, and structure.  
This is particularly useful for reviewing contracts, business agreements, and legal documents where precise difference detection is critical.

With the API, you can:

- Compare two or more **PDF files**  
- Highlight differences such as insertions, deletions, and formatting updates  
- Save the comparison results to a new PDF or another supported format  

## How to compare PDF documents in Python

To compare PDF files, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `Comparer` class and load the source PDF file.  
2. Add one or more target PDF files.  
3. Call the `compare()` method and provide the result file path.  

## Example: Compare PDF documents

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

source_path = "source.pdf"
target_path = "target.pdf"
result_path = "result.pdf"

# Initialize the comparer with the source PDF document
with gc.Comparer(source_path) as comparer:

    # Add the target PDF document
    comparer.add(target_path)

    # Compare and save the results
    comparer.compare(result_path)
```
