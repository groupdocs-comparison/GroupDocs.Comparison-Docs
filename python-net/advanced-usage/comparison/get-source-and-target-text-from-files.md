[GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net) provides access to the source and target text for each detected change.

## Get source and target text from local disk

Compare two files and print the source/target text for each change.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with gc.Comparer("source.docx") as comparer:
    comparer.add("target.docx")
    comparer.compare("result.docx")
    changes = comparer.get_changes()
    for change in changes:
        print()
        print("Source text:", change.source_text)
        print("Target text:", change.target_text)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Extract changed text pairs to power side-by-side diff review tools.

The result is as follows:

## Get source and target text from stream

Work directly with streams and retrieve the same data programmatically.

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc

with open("source.docx", "rb") as src, open("target.docx", "rb") as tgt:
    with gc.Comparer(src) as comparer:
        comparer.add(tgt)
        comparer.compare("result.docx")
        changes = comparer.get_changes()
        for change in changes:
            print()
            print("Source text:", change.source_text)
            print("Target text:", change.target_text)
```

ðŸ”¹ Use case: Feed structured change text into analytics or translation workflows.
