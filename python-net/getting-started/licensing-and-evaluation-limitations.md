Sometimes, to study the system better, you want to dive into the code as fast as possible. To make this easier, GroupDocs.Comparison provides different purchase plans or offers a Free Trial and a 30-day Temporary License for evaluation.

{{< alert style="info" >}}
Note that there are several general policies and practices that guide you on how to evaluate, properly license, and purchase our products. You can find them in the ["Purchase Policies and FAQ"](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/policies) section.

## Free Trial or Temporary License

You can try GroupDocs.Comparison without buying a license.

### Free Trial

The evaluation version is the same as the purchased one â€“ the evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you set the license. You can set the license in several ways that are described in the next sections of this article.

The evaluation version comes with the following limitations:

- Only the first 2 pages can be processed.
- Trial badges are placed in the document on the top of each page.

### Temporary License

If you wish to test GroupDocs.Comparison without the limitations of the trial version, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. For details, see the ["Get a Temporary License"](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) page.

## How to set up a license

{{< alert style="info" >}}

You can find the pricing information on the ["Pricing Information"](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/pricing/comparison/python-net) page.

{{< /alert >}}

After getting the license, you need to set it. This section describes different ways to set the license.

The license should be set:

- Only once per application domain.
- Before using any other GroupDocs.Comparison classes.

{{< alert style="info" >}}

The license can be set multiple times per application domain, but we recommend doing it once since all the subsequent calls to the `setLicense` method except for the first one will just waste processor time.

### Set License from File

The following code snippet shows how to set a license from a file:

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc
license = gc.License()
license.set_license(license_path)
```

### Set License from Stream

The following code snippet shows how to set a license from a stream:

```python
import groupdocs.comparison as gc
import os
from os.path import join

def run():
    if os.path.exists(license_path):
        with open(license_path, "rb") as stream:
            gc.License().set_license(stream)
```
