To avoid the saving stream as a file, [GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net) allows you to work with file streams directly.

To work with stream, follow these steps:

1.  Obtain file stream.
2.  Pass opened source file stream to the [Comparer](https://reference.groupdocs.com/net/comparison/groupdocs.comparison/comparer) class constructor or passÂ opened target file stream to the [Add](https://reference.groupdocs.com/net/comparison/groupdocs.comparison/comparer/methods/add/index) method.

The following code snippet shows how to load file from stream:

{{< tabs "example1">}}
{{< tab "C#" >}}
```csharp
using (Stream sourceStream = File.OpenRead("source.docx"))
using (Stream targetStream = File.OpenRead("target.docx"))
{
    using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceStream))
    {
        comparer.Add(targetStream);
        comparer.Compare(File.Create("result.docx"));
    }
}
```
