## File comparison

[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net) provides an ability to detect differences between source and target files for changes at paragraphs, words, and characters levels. It can identify styling and formatting changes like bold, italic, underlines, strike-troughs, font types, etc.

## Apply/Reject changes between documents

Every difference between compared document can be applied or rejected and then exported to the output document.

## Document information extraction

GroupDocs.Comparison allows obtaining basic information about source document - file type, size, pages count etc. For example, you can use this to generate previews of compared documents.

## Comparison summary report

Once comparison process is complete, you can save a differences summary report which lists all changes in compared documents.
