## File comparison

[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net) allows you to detect differences between source and target files for changes at paragraphs, words, and characters levels. It can identify styling and formatting changes like bold, italic, underlines, strike-troughs, font types, etc.

## Apply/Reject changes between documents

Every difference between compared documents can be applied or rejected and then exported to the output document.

## Document information extraction

GroupDocs.Comparison allows obtaining basic information about source documents - file type, size, page count, etc. For example, you can use this to generate previews of compared documents.

## Comparison summary report

Once the comparison process is complete, you can save a differences summary report that lists all changes in compared documents.
