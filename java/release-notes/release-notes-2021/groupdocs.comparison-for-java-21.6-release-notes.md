- [Improved Accept\Reject Revisions functionality for Words documents](https://docs.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/accept-or-reject-revisions/)
- Updated documentation about obtaining source and target texts, which can be found [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/get-source-and-target-text-from-files/).

- The problem with redisplaying changed content in a document occurred when there were already other _Revisions_ in the documents being compared.

**Revision** - changes received when comparing documents using built-in Word tools.

To solve this problem, new _ShowRevisions_ property was created that allows you to disable the display of these _Revisions_ in the resulting document. An example of the code for using the new property is presented below.

- Learn more about getting source and target texts, which can be found [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/get-source-and-target-text-from-files/)

```java
try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath)) {
    comparer.add(targetPath);
    CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions();
    options.setShowRevisions(false);
    final Path resultPath = comparer.compare(RESULT_PATH, options);
}
```

More information about the new property can be found [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/show-revisions/).

- Comparison of types of footnotes refers to comparison of styles, besides, this type of change is difficult to display in the text. Therefore these changes are marked on the principle of blank lines or pictures in the document (using comments).
  For clarity comparison of footnote types, you could use the following code snippet:

```java
try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath)) {
    comparer.add(targetPath);
    CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions();
    options.setDetectStyleChanges(true);
    options.setDetalisationLevel(DetalisationLevel.High);
    final Path resultPath = comparer.compare(RESULT_PATH, options);
}
```

- For some reasons result file extension can be changed, so you should use result of `compare` method instead of RESULT_PATH to get result data

```java
try(Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath)) {
    comparer.add(targetPath);
    final Path resultPath = comparer.compare(RESULT_PATH);
    if(resultPath != null) {
        // Use resultPath (if it is not null) to read the file, instead of RESULT_PATH
    }
}
```
