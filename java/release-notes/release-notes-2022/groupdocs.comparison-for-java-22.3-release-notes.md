try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath)) {
    comparer.add(targetPath);

    CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions();
    options.setDetectStyleChanges(true);
    options.setDetalisationLevel(DetalisationLevel.High);

    comparer.compare(resultPath, options);
}
```

2. Learn more about getting result document with changed content replaced with empty lines can be
