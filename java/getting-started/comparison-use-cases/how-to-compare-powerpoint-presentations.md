You may need to compare two versions of a PowerPoint Presentation to see the differences between them (e.g., if a colleague has edited it directly without noting the changes). And the quickest way to do this is with PowerPoint’s built-in Compare function. To use this:

*   Open the original version of your presentation
*   Go to **Review** > **Compare**
*   Click **Compare** to open a browser window
*   Select the edited version of the presentation and click **Merge**

You will then enter Review Mode. This will open the Reviewing Pane, which shows a list of all edits in the presentation at the right of the screen.

## How to Compare Two Presentations using GroupDocs.Comparison

Such functionality that is provided by third-party programs is clearly not enough. **[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison)** provides many features for comparing a wide range of [supported file formats]({{< ref "comparison/java/getting-started/supported-document-formats.md" >}}), including PowerPoint Presentation format. Let's make an example, you made a presentation at different times, but the elements on the slides are not located as you originally did. To find where the slides differ, you can compare two files in PPTX format using the **[GroupDocs.Comparison for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/java)** functionality along with a built-in option that helps find changes in styles.

|   |  Presentations |
| --- | --- |
|Original | ![](comparison/java/images/how-to-compare-powerpoint-presentations_1.png)|
|Modified | ![](comparison/java/images/how-to-compare-powerpoint-presentations_2.png)|

[**GroupDocs.Comparison**](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/java) provides the ability to compare two files in PPTX format(or any other [supported file formats]({{< ref "comparison/java/getting-started/supported-document-formats.md" >}}))

The following are the steps to compare two PPTX files.

*   Instantiate [Comparer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/com.groupdocs.comparison/Comparer) objectwith source document path or stream; 
*   Instantiate [CompareOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/com.groupdocs.comparison.options/CompareOptions) object with desired parameters; 
*   Call[ compare ](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/com.groupdocs.comparison/Comparer#compare(java.lang.String,%20com.groupdocs.comparison.options.CompareOptions)) method and pass [CompareOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/com.groupdocs.comparison.options/CompareOptions) object to method;

The following code samples demonstrate how to compare two PPTX files.

```java
try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(SOURCE_FILE)) {
    comparer.add(TARGET_FILE);
 
    final CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions();
    compareOptions.setDetectStyleChanges(true);
    compareOptions.setDetalisationLevel(DetalisationLevel.High);

    final Path resultPath = comparer.compare(RESULT_FILE, compareOptions);
}
```

As a result, we get a PPTX file where the deleted elements are marked in <font color="red">**red**</font>, the added – in <font color="blue">**blue**</font>, and the modified – in <font color="green">**green**</font>

| Result Slide |

To compare comments in presentation document, you have to set DetalisationLevel property to High:

```java
    try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourcePath)) {
        comparer.add(targetPath);

        CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions();
        compareOptions.setDetalisationLevel(DetalisationLevel.High);

        final Path resultPath = comparer.compare(resultPath, compareOptions);
    }
```
